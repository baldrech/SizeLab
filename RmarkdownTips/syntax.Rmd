# Introduction

Here live several examples on how to write stuff in Rmarkdown, with no apparent organisation. They are here to help you write a paper using only Rmarkdown and discard every other software away.

## Smaller headlines

There are 4 in total, just add more "#"

### Three dash headline

#### The smallest headline

# Specific text

Microsoft uses buttons, LateX uses functions and Rmarkdown uses symbol shortcut to write specific text:

*I write in italic using* \* around the expression (\_ works too)

**Bold is a possibility too using** \*\*

`In text code` such as a `variable` or a `function()` is done using \`

Subscripts uses \~ and superscripts \^, e.g. H\~3\~PO\^2+\^ renders H~3~PO^2+^

And when you want to use any of these symbols verbatim, one needs to add "\\" in front

\#, \*, \`

## Highlighting 

> write block quotes using >

> however the style appears only in HTML

There is a workaround using a LateX function:

\begin{formal}
  quote in a pdf
\end{formal}

But you need an associated .tex file which is then given to the YAML

## List of items

1. one (done using 1.)

  + more numbers

2. two

* not marked using \*

* more not marked
 
  + nested adding +
  
    + doubling down
  
## Others

Rmarkdown can also handle LateX functions such as "\\newpage"

\newpage

# Math symbols

Mathematics are done using the \$ symbol around the expression. It can be used in line $X = Y + 1$ or separate and centered using \$$

$$\alpha = e{^\beta}$$

Specific letters such as $\alpha$ (written \$\\alpha$) must be written in the math environment. The syntax is the same as LateX and can be found on https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/List_of_Greek_letters_and_math_symbols


# Citations

Citation are handled using a .bib file, generated by your favorite reference manager (Rmarkdown not doing yet unfortunately)
Add the file path to the YAML at the head of the document (bibliography: myLibrary.bib)

In text citations are done using \@ and using the unique code linking to your reference. In my case it looks like "firstAuthor_firstWord_year" but it is user dependent.

[@andersen_fish_2019] = [\@andersen_fish_2019]

[@andersen_fish_2019;@blanchard_evaluating_2014] = [\@andersen_fish_2019; \@blanchard_evaluating_2014]

@blanchard_evaluating_2014 = \@blanchard_evaluating_2014

[See @andersen_fish_2019 for details.] = [See \@andersen_fish_2019 for details.]


The style of the citations is often journal specific. Fortunately, journals provide .csl files of their own styling, which can be found on https://www.zotero.org/styles. Dowload the file and give the path to Rmarkdown in the YAML using "csl: myStyle.csl"

References will be added at the end of the document. Just add a "\#References" at the end.

# Inserting code blocks

Ctrl + Alt + i is the shortcut to insert a code chunk. Useful options are 

echo: if TRUE, display code chunk

eval: if TRUE, run the chunk

include: if TRUE, include chunk in doc

message: if TRUE, display code messages

warning: if TRUE, display code warnings

```{r, echo=F, include=T}

```



# Figures

Figures are added using \! [caption] (filePath.jpg)

![Caption about George](George.jpg)


For more control over the figure, one can use `knitr::include_graphics()`

\newpage

# Tables

Tables such as data frame are easily displayed using `knitr::kable()`

```{r car_table}
knitr::kable(head(mtcars))

```

It's so simple that it's easier to create a data frame first to make a table, than to make a table directly.

\newpage

```{r}
param_description <- data.frame("parameter" = c("w_inf","w_mat","beta"),
                               "description" = c("asymptotic weigth",
                                                 "maturation weight",
                                                 "preferred predator/prey mass ratio")
)
```


```{r params}
knitr::kable(param_description, caption = "parameters' description")
```




\newpage

# The neat stuff

## Auto-numbering and cross-referencing

This is done using the R package `bookdown`.




```{r cars, fig.cap= "a plot about cars' cylinders"}
plot(mtcars$mpg,mtcars$cyl)
```


 Figure \@ref(fig:cars) is rad. Table \@ref(tab:params) is not bad either.
 
 This reference is done automatically using \\ \ @ ref(label), where label is the name of the code-chunk referenced with its float identity, i.e the previous figure's label is `fig:cars` and the table's label is `tab:params`

## Using variables in text

```{r}
head(mtcars)
```


The number of cylinders of `r rownames(mtcars)[1]` is `r mtcars[1,2]`. The previous sentence verbatim is actually:

The number of cylinders of "r rownames(mtcars)[1]" is "r mtcars[1,2]" (just need to replace " with ')


## Remember to checkout the YAML
